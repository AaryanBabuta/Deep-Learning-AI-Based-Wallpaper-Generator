# Deep-Learning-AI-Based-Wallpaper-Generator
## Overview
This repository contains code, datasets, and documentation for deep learning AI based Wallpaper Generator project.

> This project leverages DreamBooth fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on top of the Stable Diffusion model to generate high-quality, customized AI wallpapers. The training was performed on a curated dataset of space-themed images using Google Colab, and the final model is deployed with a Gradio-based web UI for easy generation.
